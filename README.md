This code is meant to run with Node.js.  The goal of this initial version is to test the call from UCCX to see if this type of web service will work to pass phone number data to UCCX.  This initial version is dependent on the npm package Express.  The final version will have a dependency on xhr2 for the API calls to OpsGenie.
